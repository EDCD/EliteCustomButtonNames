# Contributions are welcome!

We are eager to extend our coverage for any device not yet covered.

If you would like to add a mapping for a device not yet covered, a pull request is the simplest way. If you are not *au fait* with Github, another way is to open an issue and attach your mapping as a file.

If your device is already covered but you'd like to tweak the names, by all means tweak the file locally but it probably doesn't merit a pull request unless there's a mistake.
